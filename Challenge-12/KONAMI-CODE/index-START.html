  // pressed.splice(-secretCode.length-1) will allow the array to not allow the pressed[] to have more characters than secretCode.length
  // and pressed.length-secretCode.length is basically = 1 because the splice function will not run unless the pressed array size beomes equal to the -secretCode-1 
  // for e.g 

  // for secretCode'wesbos'(length =6) -secretCode.length-1 =7
  // and splice function will not run unless pressed.length = 1
  // as soon as the the 7th character is added to function the the splice function will get to its work.
  // and pressed.length(7)-secretCode.length(6) = 1 (for any e.g second parameter should always be 1)
  
  // Now in short for above eg.
  // the splice function will remove the leftmost character for every new character added after pressed[] reach the length of 6.
  // so we can say that for every 7th character added to the pressed[] 
  // the splice function will remove the leftmost character
