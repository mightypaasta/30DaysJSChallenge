    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    /// here age is original and age2 is just a copy of age (NOTE: age2 is not the reference of age)
    /// because with string number and booleans the "=" like this will make a copy rather than an actual refrence to the original .

    /// e.g here age is 100 and age2 refer to age so age2 will make a copy of age and will have original value of age i.e 100.
    /// therefore any change in the original variable will not effect the age2 because its just a copy and not a reference .
    /// So changing age=100 to 200
    /// will not change the value of age2.
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    // same thing happens with the strings as well as booleans.
    let name = 'Eren';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'Jaegar';
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
  
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3]='Lux'

    // now here is the problem!

    /// In array simple newVariable"="oldVariable does not means copying content of oldVariable to newVariable.
    /// it simply means newVariable will now points to oldVariable for its content
    /// And any change in the newVariable will also result in change inside oldVariable 

    /// here on changing the value of team at index 3 will also change the value of players at index3
    /// because team is not the copy of players array , it is just a reference to players.
    /// reason behind this is array cannot be copied like string, numbers or booleans are copied in js.
    /// so any change in the team array will also effect the players array.
  
    /// e.g here replacing 'Poppy' with 'Lux' in teams will change the 'Poppy' in players array also.
    /// as team[3]='Lux'
    /// the machine will think that we want to change the value of the array which we are referring to
    /// here in this case is players array
    console.log(players,team);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    
    /// There are many ways to copy an array
    const team2=players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4=[...players];

    const team5=Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team5[3]='Lisa';
    console.log(team5,players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const captain = person;
    captain.name='Eren Jaegar'

    console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    /// One way to do it is using assign({},ObjectName,{change in any of its attribute/property}) operator.
    
    /// in .assign() first declare empty object by {} ',' followed object name u want to copy from.
    /// atlast(OPTIONAL) change any attributes of that object if u want to inside {} operator 
    
    const captain2= Object.assign({},person,{name: 'Levi Ackerman', age:50});
    console.log(captain2,person);
    
    /// Second way of doing it by using {...ObjectName} Spread Operator
    const captain3= {... person};
    console.log(captain3,person);
    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    
    /// Some drawbacks of apply() function 
    const protagonist = {
      name: 'Eren Jaegar',
      age: 21,
      power:{
        attackTitan: 'Can see future',
        foundingTitan: 'Can control all other titans including "WALL TITANS"',
        warHammerTitan: 'Can create hardening weapons out of his body'
      },
      character:'HERO',
      social:{
        twitter:'@GodOfAllTime',
        email: 'godofalltime@gmail.com'
      }
    }
    
    /// However the assign() function will only provide one layer deep copy of the object
    /// because the assign() function only provide one layer of copy and all the inside layers(objects) will be referenced
    /// For e.g if u change the value of twitter inside the social object of protagonist2
    /// then it will also change the value of twitter inside the protagonist
    
    const protagonist2= Object.assign({},protagonist)
    protagonist2.social.twitter='@noGodOfAllTime';
    /// after the above line the value of twitter of both object(protagonist and protagonist2) will change

    console.log(protagonist2.social.twitter,protagonist.social.twitter);
    console.log('Here the twitter value of both protagonist2 and protagonist will change');

    /// One way to overcome this is to use json.parse(json.stringify(ObjectName))
    /// By this way the json.stringigy will first convert the object into string by " " it.
    /// Then we will use the json.parese which unstringfy or it will convert into object again.
    /// BEWARE IT WILL HAVE PERFORMANCE ISSUES.

    const protagonist3=JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(protagonist));
    protagonist3.social.email='nogodofalltime@gmail.com';
    console.log(protagonist3.social.email,protagonist.social.email);
    console.log('Here the email value of protagonist3 will not effect the orginal email value of protagonist');

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
